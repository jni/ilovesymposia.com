<html><body><p>Apparently <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/05/better-place-bankruptcy-report/">Better Place is preparing for bankruptcy</a>. I wrote an <a href="http://ilovesymposia.com/2009/07/18/the-electric-car-of-the-present/">optimistic post</a> about Better Place years ago, when they were just about to launch. They created a swappable battery system for electric cars along with corresponding battery swap stations. In my opinion, these were the most credible cure to range anxiety for electric vehicles. Batteries take a long time to charge, even on Tesla's <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/charging#/onthego">Supercharger stations</a>, which they ludicrously refer to as "super-quick" just because they can give you half a charge in half an hour. A swap in Better Place's stations took two minutes.

Adoption of electric vehicles will remain minuscule until the range problem can be fixed. With transport accounting for about 20% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions worldwide, significant EV adoption would be a massive boon to the fight against climate change. And with Better Place out of the picture, that goal became just a little bit less real.</p></body></html>
