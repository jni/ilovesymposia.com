<html><body><p>Michael Eisen speaking about <a href="f1000research.com">F1000 Research</a> to <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/plos-profits-prompt-revamp-1.14205">Nature</a>:
</p><blockquote>“They are doing lots of things that PLOS should have done five years ago.”</blockquote>
I recently <a href="ilovesymposia.com/2013/10/04/why-plos-one-is-no-longer-my-default-journal/">ranted</a> about PLOS ONE (while still endorsing their mission) for this very reason. It's good to know that the very top knows they need to adapt.</body></html>
