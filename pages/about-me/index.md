I'm a bioimage informatics research fellow and CZI imaging software fellow at
Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Previously I've been a freelance
consultant, a research scientist at Melbourne Bioinformatics (University of
Melbourne), a research associate at the Janelia Research Campus (where I worked
with Mitya Chklovskii) and PhD student at the University of Southern California
(where I studied computational biology under by Xianghong Jasmine Zhou).

Together with my mentor, [Stéfan van der Walt](https://mentat.za.net/), and my
friend, [Harriet Dashnow](http://harrietdashnow.com/), I co-wrote [Elegant
SciPy](http://elegant-scipy.org), a book about effective and elegant uses of
the SciPy (scientific Python) library. If you like it, please

<span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">I love movies and my four favourites are </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">American Beauty</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">, </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">The Professional</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">, </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">Dark City</em>, and <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">.</span>

My favourite TV show is <em>Futurama</em>, by miles.

My favourite videogames are The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo64), Portal (PC), Ninja Gaiden Σ (PS3), and Super Mario Odyssey (Switch).

I'm an avid skier, climber, and cyclist.

Here are two very nice quotes that are quite close in content but separated in time:

"There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."

<p style="text-align:right;">J.R.R. Tolkien, in <em>The Return of the King</em></p>

"I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain, and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life."

<p style="text-align:right;">Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), in <em>American Beauty</em> (written by Alan Ball)</p>
