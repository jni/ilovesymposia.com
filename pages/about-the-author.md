<html><body><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-702" src="https://ilovesymposia.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/img_0111.jpg?w=474" alt="img_0111" width="237" height="300">I'm a freelance consultant Research Scientist at Melbourne Bioinformatics at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Prior positions include Research Associate at HHMI Janelia Farm (where I worked with Mitya Chklovskii) and Research Assistant / PhD student at the University of Southern California (where I studied computational biology supervised by Xianghong Jasmine Zhou).

I get cold easily. =P

My principal research interests are neuroscience and image analysis. I am also interested in graph methods in bioinformatics, and in biostatistics.

<span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">I love movies and my four favourites are </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">American Beauty</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">, </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">The Professional</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">, </span><em style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">Dark City</em>, and <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em><span style="line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;">.</span>

My favourite TV show is <em>Futurama</em>, by miles.

My favourite videogames are The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo64), Portal (PC), and Ninja Gaiden Σ (PS3), although I've been out of the scene for a while.

I'm an avid skier, climber, and cyclist.

Here are two very nice quotes that are quite close in content but quite separated in time:

"There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."

<p style="text-align:right;">J.R.R. Tolkien, in <em>The Return of the King</em></p>

"I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain, and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life."
