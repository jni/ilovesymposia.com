<html><body><p>I thought it fitting that the inaugural post on my blog be about a talk at a symposium, specifically the <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED conference</a> in Monterey, CA. TED stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design, its original focus (foci?), but it has expanded to just about anything that's innovative. Huge names participate in TED (Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, Brian Greene, to name a few), and attendance is limited to 1,000. The result is utterly fascinating. Many of the talks are free to watch online.

Jeff Hawkins (founder of Palm and the Redwood Neuroscience Institute) gave his vision on the past and future of brain science in the most entertaining fashion <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/125">here</a>.
