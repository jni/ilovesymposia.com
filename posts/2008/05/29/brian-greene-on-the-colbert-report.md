<html><body><p>I promise sometime soon I'll write something <em>not</em> about someone else's videos! But for now, enjoy theoretical physicist <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=167386">Brian Greene on the Colbert Report</a>. Stephen drives an excellent interview, as usual, and proves <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=76296">yet again</a> that he either knows a good deal of science, or he does his homework before talking about it. As a result, science coverage on the Colbert Report is invariably excellent.Â <a href="http://ilovesymposia.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&amp;post=4&amp;message=4"></a></p></body></html>
