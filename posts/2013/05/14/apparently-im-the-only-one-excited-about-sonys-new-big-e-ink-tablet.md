<html><body><p>Both <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/13/4325948/sony-digital-paper-large-screen-ereader-years-late">The Verge</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/13/sonys-got-a-13-3-inch-e-reader-with-pen-input-which-is-sort-of-like-a-dodo-with-antlers/">Techcrunch</a> are quite negative about <a href="http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201305/13-058/">Sony's big new device</a>... So much so that they compelled me to write this post. <em>Someone</em> should give Sony some positive coverage! I think it's an excellent idea, and if Sony needs some enthusiastic testers down under, they should send this thing my way. ;)

For those of you that haven't seen it, Sony's new device is dubbed "e-paper", has a roomy 13.3" e-ink-like display, and you can write on said display with the included stylus.

Both of the above publications seem to think that everything is fine in tablet-land and that the iPad and company already serve whatever need Sony's new tablet tries to fill. Well, I'm here to tell them that the iPad (<em>et al</em>) sucks for some things. Three of those are: (1) taking handwritten notes,  (2) reading (some) pdfs in full-page view, and (3) reading in full daylight. By the sound of it, Sony's new tablet will excel at all three, and that has me excited.</body></html>
