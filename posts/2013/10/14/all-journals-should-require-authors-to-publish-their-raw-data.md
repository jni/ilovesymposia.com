<html><body><p>This is just a link post. The excellent and excellently-named <a href="http://datacolada.org/">Data Colada</a> blog has a <a href="http://datacolada.org/2013/09/17/just_posting_it_works/">brilliant analysis</a> of scientific fraud exposed by the raw data. Figures can obscure flaws that are immediately obvious in the numbers. (Although, Matt Terry's awesome and hilarious <a href="https://github.com/mrterry/yoink">Yoink</a> might alleviate this.) In this case, averages of four numbers turning out to be integers <em>every single time</em><em>, </em>and two independent experiments giving almost exactly the same distribution of values. (Frankly, if you can't simulate random sampling from an underlying distribution, you don't belong in the fraud world!)</p><p>The post demonstrates the importance of publishing as much data (and code) as possible with a paper. Words are fuzzy; data and code are precise.</p><p>See <a href="http://datacolada.org/2013/09/17/just_posting_it_works/">here</a> for more.</p></body></html>
