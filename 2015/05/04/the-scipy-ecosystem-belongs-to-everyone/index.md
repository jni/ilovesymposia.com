<html><body><p>I use Twitter favourites almost exclusively to mark posts that I know will be <em>useful</em> in some not-too-distant future; kind of like a Twitter Evernote. Recently I was looking through my list in search of <a href="http://www.pydanny.com/building-conda-packages-for-multiple-operating-systems.html">this excellent blog post</a> detailing how to build cross-platform binary distributions for <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/">conda</a>.

I came across two other tweets from the EuroSciPy 2014 conference: <a href="https://twitter.com/ianozsvald/status/505739079590608896">this one</a> by Ian Ozsvald about his <a href="https://github.com/ianozsvald/ipython_memory_usage">IPython memory usage</a> profiler, right next to <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexChabotL/status/505746290412888065">this one</a> by Alexandre Chabot about Aaron O'Leary's <a href="https://github.com/aaren/notedown">notedown</a>. I'd forgotten that this was how I came across these two tools, but since then I have contributed code to both (<a href="https://github.com/ianozsvald/ipython_memory_usage/pull/1">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aaren/notedown/pull/15">2</a>). I'd met Ian at EuroSciPy 2013, but I've never met Aaron, yet nevertheless there is my code in the latest version of his notedown library.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

How remarkable the open-source Python community has become. Talks from Python conferences are posted to YouTube, usually <em>as the conference is happening</em>. (Add to that plenty of live tweeting.) Thus, even when I can't attend the conferences, I can keep up with the latest open source libraries, from the other side of the world. And then I can grab the source code on GitHub, fiddle with it to my heart's content, and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">submit a pull request</a> to the author with my changes. After a short while, code that I wrote for my own utility is available for anyone else to use through PyPI or conda.

My point is: join us! <a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2014/03/10/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/">Make your code open source</a>, and conversely, when you need some functionality, don't reinvent the wheel. See if there's a library that <em>almost</em> meets your needs, and contribute!</p></body></html>
