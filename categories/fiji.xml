napari with the world.
We have been developing napari &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari"&gt;in the open&lt;/a&gt;
from the very first commit, but we didn't want to make any premature fanfare
about it… Until now. It's still alpha software, but for months now, both the
core napari team and a few collaborators/early adopters have been using napari
in our daily work. I've found it life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking for a great nD volume viewer in Python for the better part of
a decade. In 2009, I joined Mitya Chklovskii's lab and the FlyEM team at the
Janelia [Farm] Research Campus to work on the segmentation of 3D electron
microscopy (EM) volumes. I started out in Matlab, but moved to Python pretty
quickly and it was a very smooth transition (highly recommended! ;). Looking at
my data was always annoying though. I was either looking at single 2D slices
using &lt;code&gt;matplotlib.pyplot.imshow&lt;/code&gt;, or saving the volumes in VTK format and
loading them into ITK-SNAP — which worked ok but required me to constantly be
changing terminals, and anyway was pretty inefficient because my disk ended up
cluttered with “temporary” VTK volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a bunch of things after that time, including Mayavi and even building my
own orthogonal views viewer with Matplotlib (which was super slow), but nothing
really clicked. What's worse, I didn't see any movement on this — I even found
a very discouraging thread on MNE-Python in which Gaël Varoquaux concluded,
given the lack of support, that 3D visualisation was not mission critical to
anyone and not worth pursuing further. (!) Throughout that time, I kept living
with either manually picking out 2D slices, or going back to tools outside of
Python, with all the context switching that entailed. The end result is
that I was looking at my data far less than I should have been, which slowed
down my work. I can't count the number of silly mistakes I made and dead ends I
chased, just because I wasn't looking at the data enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime though, I was busy improving support for n-dimensional images
in scikit-image. In May last year, Nelle Varoquaux organised a joint sprint with
developers from scikit-learn, scikit-image, and dask at UC Berkeley, and I was
one of the lucky invitees. I'd recently seen that
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loicaroyer"&gt;Loïc Royer&lt;/a&gt;, a good friend
from my Janelia days, had moved to San Francisco to start his lab at the Chan
Zuckerberg Biohub, so I asked him if I could crash at his place for a few days
before the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew Loïc as a Java guy. In Janelia he'd repeatedly extolled the virtues of
Java to me, and since then he'd worked on some incredible Java software,
including ClearVolume, a super-fast 3D viewer, and ClearControl, a super-fast
microscope control library (you might detect a theme there ;).  In fact,
although I love Python and its ecosystem and what we've built with
scikit-image, I've always been intimidated by Fiji and its ecosystem and its
&lt;del&gt;10,000&lt;/del&gt; 15,000 citations. Was I deluding myself that Python was important in
biology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was both shocked and delighted when Loïc casually mentioned that he needed
a fast nD viewer in Python, and that we should build it together. Loïc had been
pushing the state of the art of deep learning in microscopy (and continues to
do so), and, despite the hard work of many to integrate Fiji with the major
deep learning learning libraries (which are Python), as well as the wider
scientific Python ecosystem, it remains challenging to use both together. It
might well remain so, because the build, installation, and dependency tooling
is so disparate between the two communities.  And so that evening, in Loïc's
apartment, napari (lowercase n) was born (though it did not yet have a name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/loic-walking-sf.jpg" alt="Loïc walking SF" style="width:100%"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loïc walking around San Francisco the weekend after I landed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from his work on ClearVolume, Loïc and I agreed on some founding
design principles for our tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;n-dimensional first;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;native (neither of us likes opening a browser to work);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blazing fast (GPU-powered);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;native 2D and 3D viewing; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimal new windows and pop-ups, choosing layering instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of speed, we knew it was doable, thanks to Martin Weigert's excellent
3D volume viewer, &lt;a href="https://github.com/maweigert/spimagine"&gt;spimagine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, at the Berkeley sprint, I finally met Kira Evans, a contributor
to scikit-image who had made several incredibly technical pull requests, on my
favourite topic of extending n-dimensional support, and whom I'd thus asked
Nelle to invite to the sprint. She had turned out to be a freshman at
Northeastern University, but despite her age she was already doing great things
in open source. In general, life is a big accumulation of small decisions you
don't even think about. On certain rare occasions, though, you make decisions
on which you look back and think, hot damn that was a good decision! Inviting
Kira is one of those for me. (Nelle agreed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/kira-john-emma-me-dask.jpg" alt="John explains dask-image" style="width:100%"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Kirkham explains dask-image to Kira, Emmanuelle Gouillart, and me at the Berkeley sprint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That week at the sprint, Loïc was able to hack out a quick prototype.
Meanwhile, Kira was busy helping scikit-image with n-dimensional rotations,
LowLevelCallables in C and Cython, and various other crazy things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll take a short moment to acknowledge &lt;a href="http://vispy.org"&gt;VisPy&lt;/a&gt;, which is the
basis for all of napari's visualisation: napari's canvas is a VisPy canvas, its
events are VisPy events, and its visual building blocks are VisPy Visuals. I
don't know the history of VisPy, but I want to thank all its
&lt;a href="https://github.com/vispy/vispy/graphs/contributors"&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt;, especially
Almar Klein, who drove it for a very long time, and David Hoese, who
resurrected it when Almar could no longer maintain it, and who maintains
it today. VisPy is yet another example of open source software being
&lt;a href="https://ilovesymposia.com/2019/05/28/why-citations-are-not-enough-for-open-source-software/"&gt;inadequately supported by academia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next weekend, on the Caltrain to the &lt;a href="https://computerhistory.org/"&gt;Computing History
Museum&lt;/a&gt;, we worked on choosing a name.
After playing around with some terrible acronyms, we
decided to continue the theme of Pacific islands begun by Fiji (though
Fiji itself is a spectacular recursive acronym, “Fiji Is Just ImageJ”).
We needed a starting point, and we settled on the
geographic midpoint between Loïc's base of San Francisco and mine of Melbourne.
That's in the middle of the ocean, of course, but not too far from
the tiny village of Napari, in the Republic of Kiribati. We
thought it had a nice ring to it, and the name stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a big risk of napari never getting off the ground. Starting a new lab
is hard work, and Loïc
knew he would not have time to develop it further. He did, however, have some
funds available for a summer intern, and after seeing the work Kira did that
week, he offered her the internship. (As a result, Kira is now officially a
college dropout and full-time software engineer at CZI, the Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative.) That summer, under the guidance of Loïc, Stéfan van der Walt, and
myself, Kira put together the first implementation of napari as you see it
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late summer/early fall, although internally napari was quite a mess, as
tends to happen in new, fast-growing projects, functionally it was already
impressive enough that Jeremy Freeman and Nick Sofroniew, from CZI's
Computational Biology division, started paying close attention. Nick, who'd
had similar experiences to mine working with Python and nD images, fell in
love with it, and literally could not wait for us to move it forward. He took
matters into his own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Nick brought some brilliant management to napari, instituting weekly
meetings that he drove (and continues to drive) like a champion. Those meetings
were critical to bringing others into the loop, including Ahmet Can Solak, Kevin
Yamauchi, Bryant Chunn, and Shannon Axelrod, who started to make pull requests
to improve napari.  Pretty soon, though, Nick made his own pull request, and
after that it was like seeing a racecar take off.  No one has done more for
napari than Nick, and Loïc and I owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/spacetx/starfish"&gt;StarFISH team&lt;/a&gt; at
CZI adopted napari as their main image viewer, which again helped us
discover bugs, improve our UI, and add features. By February, everyone in the
project was using it regularly, despite its warts. We started to think about
broadening the group of people with eyes on napari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/nick-neurodegen-meeting.jpg" alt="Nick demoing napari" style="width:100%"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick shows napari to attendees of the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@cziscience/building-a-scientific-community-that-is-more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts-ffc0171617a5"&gt;Neurodegeneration Challenge Network Investigators Meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Februrary. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cziscience/status/1101005066599723009"&gt;Photo by CZI Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CZI was organising a meeting for grantees of its &lt;a href="https://go.chanzuckerberg.com/imaging"&gt;Imaging
Scientists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.chanzuckerberg.com/imaging#imaging-software-fellows"&gt;Imaging Software
Fellows&lt;/a&gt;
programs in March, which we thought would be a good opportunity to grow the
team. Among others, we invited John Kirkham (NVIDIA) and Eric Perlman (then at
Johns Hopkins, now freelancing). The CZI meeting was a dramatic demonstration of the power of
bringing together people with complementary experience, as John added support
for viewing bigger-than-RAM &lt;a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array.html"&gt;dask
arrays&lt;/a&gt; in about 20 minutes flat,
and Eric massively improved the performance of our segmentation visualisation
layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loïc explaining napari's design to John Kirkham and Wei Ouyang at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub the day after the CZI meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out of the March meeting thinking hey, this napari thing might have legs!
Not only had newcomers been able to improve it quickly without knowing
the codebase (which usually points to at least &lt;em&gt;decent&lt;/em&gt; design), but we heard
over and over from the imaging scientists that viewing and annotating large
datasets remained a challenge for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we started gently expanding the user base, but in hushed tones, full of
caveats: “This software we're working on might be useful for you… If you're
brave and can work around all the missing functionality… Be sure to report any
issues…” One of our most frequent requests, which was indeed part of the napari
plan from the very beginning, was 3D volume rendering, and Pranathi Vemuri, a
data scientist at the Biohub, implemented that just in time for SciPy 2019. At
that conference, Nick presented napari to the public for the first time,
because many SciPy attendees tend to not mind working with development versions
of libraries. Indeed, we got contributions that week from Alex de Siqueira
(from the scikit-image team) and Matthias Bussonnier (IPython).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest revelation for me, though, came immediately after SciPy, when I
went to Jackson Lab to teach a workshop on scikit-image. I've taught
scikit-image many times before, but for the first time, I went off-script and
analysed new data live, on IPython, rather than using Jupyter notebooks
pre-populated with toy data. I used napari instead of matplotlib, and found
napari's layers model &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; useful to visualise every step of the
analysis, one on top of the other, toggling their visibility on and off to
compare them. And it was super easy to add interactivity to the mix, clicking
on some points in napari, then grabbing those points to use as watershed seeds,
and popping the resulting segmentation as another layer to napari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/napari-annotated-coins.png" alt="Annotated Coins" style="width:100%"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Combining interactive annotation and segmentation algorithms with napari.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months since then, we've spent a lot of time improving the code, and
polishing the little edge cases, like making sure the coordinates reported by
the cursor are pixel perfect, merging the previously separate Image (2D) and
Volume (3D) layers, and extending 3D and multi-resolution support to all
layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to CZI's massive in-house investment in open source, we also actually
got an &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/469"&gt;audit&lt;/a&gt; for napari's GUI
from Lia Prins, a UX designer at CZI — an incredible opportunity that few
academic projects get. And, to repeat a familiar pattern, Nick immediately got
to work and implemented a bunch of fixes from the audit. To me, this update is
what's most pushed me to write this post, as the UI now feels more like a
coherent whole than the mishmash of features that results from organic growth
of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;napari now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned at the start, currently, everyone on the team uses napari on a
daily basis for their own work. Our workflows actually look quite
different, yet napari meets the needs of all of them, in some form or another.
Last month we were surprised to find that Constantin Pape, at EMBL, was
developing his own viewer, Heimdall, on top of napari, completely independently
from us. I'm a big fan of Constantin's work, so little has brought me more joy
than finding his &lt;a href="https://github.com/constantinpape/heimdall"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; and reading
this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of the credit goes to napari; it's so great to finally have a decent
python viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are those use cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Just &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; at NumPy ndarrays quickly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my most common use case. I like to think about and use 2D, 3D, and 4D
images interchangeably. So, I often find myself calling &lt;code&gt;plt.imshow&lt;/code&gt; on a 3D
array and being greeted by a &lt;code&gt;TypeError: Invalid dimensions for image data&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the figure window has popped up, which now stares back at me blank and
forlorn. No more, with &lt;code&gt;napari.view_image&lt;/code&gt;. By default, napari will display the
last two dimensions of an array, and put in as many sliders as necessary for
the remaining dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, I'll create a syntethic 4D array of blobs using scikit-image's
&lt;code&gt;binary_blobs&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;blobs_raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binary_blobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n_dim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;volume_fraction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;blobs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gaussian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blobs_raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;256&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we can look at the volume in napari:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to VisPy and OpenGL, the canvas is just
blazing fast, and a joy to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using napari, we can immediately see that the blobs grow dramatically along
the leading axis. With my previous matplotlib workflow, I might have missed
that, as I would only look at one or two slices before continuing my workflow
in whatever preconceived direction I'd chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can click on the little cube icon to switch to a 3D view (or type
&lt;code&gt;viewer.dims.ndisplay = 3&lt;/code&gt; in our IPython terminal). Napari will remove
one of the sliders, and display a maximum intensity projection of the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width="90%" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/napari-blobs-3d-720p.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/napari-blobs-3d-720p.ogg" type="video/ogg"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/napari-blobs-3d-720p-frame.jpg" title="Your browser does not support the video tag."&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White blobs turn out to not look so great in maximum intensity, so let's look
at the 3D view with the famous
&lt;a href="http://fiji.sc/downloads/Spindly-GFP.zip"&gt;mitosis dataset&lt;/a&gt; from Fiji's sample
data (which I think comes from
&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064361/"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; by Griffis,
Stuurman and Vale, but I'm not sure...):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;mitosis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'mitosis.tif'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# make sure your working directory is right&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mitosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;196&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;171&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those axes are time, z, channels, y, and x (TZCYX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mitosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'mitosis'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As above, you can see the last two dimensions displayed, then sliders for the
remaining dimensions. The sliders are proportionally sized to the number of
slices along each axis, making it easy to figure out which axis is what. (This
was one of Lia's recommendations that Nick implemented.) (And yes, labeled axes
are in our roadmap!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: 2019-10-28:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;removed broken use of &lt;code&gt;view_multichannel&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to see the two channels as individual images to overlay, rather than as
an extra dimension.  We can do this manually with two &lt;code&gt;add_image&lt;/code&gt; calls, adding
a scale keyword argument to account for the different scales in xy and in z:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;contrast_limits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mitosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;colormap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'green'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Overlaying computation results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the first time it really hit me how useful napari could
be was when I was teaching scikit-image at Jackson lab. Napari uses a layered
display model, so you can keep adding layers on top of each other, and change
their opacity or visibility on the fly. This makes it really convenient to
examine the steps of a pipeline as you process data, and maybe try different
methods if the results don't look so great mid-pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, I open napari from IPython and I keep adding layers as I try
different segmentation methods on the coins example image from scikit-image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Annotating data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it can be difficult to get an algorithm to pick out exactly what
you want in an image. With the right UI, however, annotation can be extremely
fast, and just a little interaction can dramatically help automated algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;segmentation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;morphology&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'coins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sobel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;edges_layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;colormap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'magenta'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'additive'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;pts_layer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pts_layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'add'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# annotate the background and all the coins, in that order&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pts_layer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinates_int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;markers_raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;zeros_like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;markers_raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;tuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinates_int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coordinates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# raw markers might be in a little watershed "well".&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;markers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;morphology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dilation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;markers_raw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;morphology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;disk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;segments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;segmentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;watershed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;markers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;markers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Viewing very large (dask) arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to John Kirkham's work, napari only loads the data that
it needs to display. Therefore, virtual arrays such as Dask arrays, HDF5
datasets, and zarr files can be loaded quickly and easily into napari, provided
that the individual slices are small enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's microscopes produce datasets ranging in the hundreds of GB to multiple
TB in size. Berkeley's Gokul Upadhyayula has made his lattice light sheet data
publicly available. Nick converted this to a
&lt;a href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;zarr file&lt;/a&gt; for ease of access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can use a dask array to view this 100GB array quickly and easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;da&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;da&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_zarr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expanduser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'~/data/gokul-lls/aollsm-m4-560nm.zarr'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'560nm'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;colormap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'magma'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;contrast_limits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Quickly looking at images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you &lt;code&gt;pip install napari&lt;/code&gt;, you also get a command-line client that lets
you quickly view image stacks. Here is a
&lt;a href="https://ilovesymposia.com/data/droso-ovarioles-isotropic.tif"&gt;downsampled, isotropic version&lt;/a&gt; of
&lt;a href="https://figshare.com/articles/_/9985568"&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; from my colleagues,
Volker Hilsenstein and André Nogueira Alves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;napari ~/data/ovarioles/droso-ovarioles-isotropic.tif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the &lt;a href="https://samples.scif.io/EmbryoCE.zip"&gt;4D C. elegans embryo&lt;/a&gt; from the

&lt;p&gt;Or a data set of many images, such as the red blood cell spectrin network from
my
&lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/4312/"&gt;work with Adam Blanch in Leann Tilley's lab&lt;/a&gt;
(data available from the &lt;a href="https://osf.io"&gt;Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/SVPFU"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Parameter sweeps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hat tip to Davis Bennett at Janelia, who
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/d-v-b/5dbdb7513d07e3360cbe5c0f3d5cacb6"&gt;came up&lt;/a&gt;
with this one. Suppose you want to manually find the best threshold for an
image. Thanks to dask's lazy evaluation, you can attach a function call to a
dimension slider, and use that slider to call the function with many
different parameter choices. And napari's dimensions model tries to mirror
NumPy's
&lt;a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/theory.broadcasting.html"&gt;broadcasting rules&lt;/a&gt;,
so that you can view data of different dimensionality together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;dask&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;da&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;from_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;chunks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;all_thresholds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;da&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;coins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'coins'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;all_thresholds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'thresholded'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;colormap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'magenta'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'additive'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can even have a bit of fun at the end with 3D rendering... 🙃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just a cute demo. I actually found this trick
&lt;a href="https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4194#issuecomment-537420178"&gt;really useful&lt;/a&gt;
when investigating a bug in scikit-image. By varying the threshold
for h-maxima, I could see detections blinking in and out of existence, even
though they are supposed to only decrease as the parameter value is increased,
thus confirming that there is a bug in the scikit-image implementation of
h-maxima! 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, improving that example for this post, the broadcasting works with
points, too, not just images!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'heatmap.npy'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;viewer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;napari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;view_image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'original'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;colormap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'green'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class="n"&gt;blending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'additive'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hmaxima&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;linspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;100.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Overlay polygons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Nick's earliest contributions was one of his biggest: a vector-based
"shapes" layer for polygons, rectangles, circles, and other annotations. This
makes it very easy to replicate things like the &lt;a href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_active_contours.html"&gt;active
contours&lt;/a&gt;
scikit-image example, without having to flip coordinates, because napari is an
image-first library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage.color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgb2gray&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;skimage.segmentation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;active_contour&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;astro&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astronaut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;astro_gray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rgb2gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;astro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. More!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick has been working hard to improve our
&lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari-tutorials"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, which will have more
details about all of the above. Meanwhile, Ahmet Can and Bryant are busy making
it easier to use napari to view images live from a microscope, or another
source. We look forward to hearing more use cases from you! Your first point of
contact to ask for help should be the &lt;a href="https://forum.image.sc"&gt;image.sc forum&lt;/a&gt;
— don't forget to use the "napari" tag!  — as well as our &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari"&gt;GitHub
issues&lt;/a&gt; for bug reports and feature requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a good time to emphasise that &lt;strong&gt;napari is still in alpha&lt;/strong&gt;, which
means that we might change the API at any time. This is not to discourage you
from using it, but rather to point out that you should be ready to evolve
quickly with it, or pin to the current minor version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our vision for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding like a broken record, napari has already proven itself
insanely useful for all of us at the team, as well as a few extended members of
our community. But we are just getting started. We want to napari to help not
just Python practitioners, but also biologists and other scientists who want to
access Python's enormous scientific ecosystem, but don't necessarily want to
learn Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/263"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; on a plugin system
to allow the data from napari layers to be the input to Python functions, and
have their outputs appear as new layers. A sneak peek:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src="https://ilovesymposia.com/napari/napari-plugins-720p-frame.jpg" title="Your browser does not support the video tag."&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are building this in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/140"&gt;collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with the
developers of &lt;a href="https://imjoy.io/"&gt;ImJoy&lt;/a&gt; to make our plugins cross-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to applying functions and seeing the outputs (what ImJoy's Wei
Ouyang refers to as &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; plugins), we see napari as a basis for more
complex interactivity, such as closed-loop learning in the style of
&lt;a href="https://www.ilastik.org/"&gt;Ilastik&lt;/a&gt;, skeleton tracing, 3D annotation, and more.
We already provide a framework to add or modify keyboard shortcuts or
mouse interactivity, so it's possible to write this functionality on top of
napari &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. But we want to provide a &lt;em&gt;unified&lt;/em&gt; framework that will prevent
plugins from clobbering each other's functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim for the plugin framework is for every function to produce
valid and &lt;em&gt;readable&lt;/em&gt; Python code, so that path from performing a set of
operations to producing a Python module — and thus a plugin — is perfectly
smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the March CZI meeting, someone asked me whether we would
provide a headless mode for napari processing. Yes and no: Our motto developing
the plugin system is that &lt;em&gt;napari-headless is just Python.&lt;/em&gt;
With the recording capability and built-in IPython console, we think that
napari could be a platform to teach
non-computational scientists the basics of Python, thus providing an
accelerated loop converting scientists from users to plugin
contributors, and then to library contributors, and improving the whole
ecosystem in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Join us!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a little over a year, napari has grown beyond what I thought possible. But
we still have a lot of work to do! In addition to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues"&gt;issues
list&lt;/a&gt;, we have an &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/420"&gt;open
roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to jump in and
join the fray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also encourage you to contribute to the many open source projects on which we
depend, starting with VisPy: if you have OpenGL experience, they could really
use your help! Other libraries we build on include
NumPy, SciPy, IPython, QtConsole, ImageIO, scikit-image, QtPy, and PyOpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried to name people's contributions to napari as they happened, but so
many have helped to build it, it was impossible to name everyone. Our
ever-growing &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/graphs/contributors"&gt;committers list&lt;/a&gt;
can be found on GitHub, but many more have contributed in countless ways. CZI's
Shannon Axelrod and Ambrose Carr helped us make early design decisions when they
adopted napari as the main viewer for StarFISH. Charlotte Weaver helped us build
a (still upcoming) binary installer, and serves on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/napari/napari/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"&gt;Code of
Conduct&lt;/a&gt;
(modelled after SciPy's). Greg Johnson and his team at the Allen Institute have
used napari to build a corpus of annotated images — and helped drive
the design of napari for that use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Imaging Kickoff Meeting last March, since CZI had invited me, I was
staying at a hotel downtown rather than at Loïc's. One night, Loïc sent me an
exasperated message that still brings a smile to my face: “You know, if you'd
stayed at your stupid hotel a year ago, there would be no napari.” It
constantly amazes me how many things had to line up for napari to exist, let
alone be where it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so grateful to everyone who has helped napari get to get to this point. If
I haven't mentioned your contribution, please email me and I'll make it right.

A couple of updates on the topic: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’ve made a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jni/fiji-python"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; with a template project encapsulating my tips from that post. It’s very simple to get a Fiji Jython script working from that template. As an example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jni/snemi-eval"&gt;here’s&lt;/a&gt; a script to evaluate segmentations using the metric used by the &lt;a href="https://ilovesymposia.com/2014/03/15/an-update-on-mixing-java-and-python-with-fiji/brainiac2.mit.edu/SNEMI3D/"&gt;SNEMI3D segmentation challenge&lt;/a&gt; (a slightly modified version of the adapted Rand error). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, this entire discussion might be rendered obsolete by two incredible projects from the &lt;a href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/"&gt;CellProfiler&lt;/a&gt; team: &lt;a href="https://github.com/CellProfiler/python-javabridge"&gt;Python-Javabridge&lt;/a&gt;, which allows Python to interact seamlessly with Java code, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/CellProfiler/python-bioformats"&gt;Python-Bioformats&lt;/a&gt;, which uses Python-Javabridge to read Bioformats images into Python. I have yet to play with them, but both look like cleaner alternatives to interact with ImageJ than my Jython scripting! At some point I’ll write a post exploring these tools, but if you get to it before me, please mention it in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
