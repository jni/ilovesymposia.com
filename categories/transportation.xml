I wrote an &lt;a href="http://ilovesymposia.com/2009/07/18/the-electric-car-of-the-present/"&gt;optimistic post&lt;/a&gt; about Better Place years ago, when they were just about to launch. They created a swappable battery system for electric cars along with corresponding battery swap stations. In my opinion, these were the most credible cure to range anxiety for electric vehicles. Batteries take a long time to charge, even on Tesla's &lt;a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/charging#/onthego"&gt;Supercharger stations&lt;/a&gt;, which they ludicrously refer to as "super-quick" just because they can give you half a charge in half an hour. A swap in Better Place's stations took two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoption of electric vehicles will remain minuscule until the range problem can be fixed. With transport accounting for about 20% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions worldwide, significant EV adoption would be a massive boon to the fight against climate change. And with Better Place out of the picture, that goal became just a little bit less real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cars</category><category>climate change</category><category>co2 emissions</category><category>electric vehicles</category><category>EVs</category><category>Tesla</category><category>transportation</category><guid>https://jni.github.io/ilovesymposia.com/posts/2013/05/25/a-sad-day-in-the-fight-against-climate-change/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 16:16:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
