<html><body><p>Being an Ãœber-Geek, I of course own an iPhone. This morning was therefore upgrade time for me, to firmware v2.0. Everything went pretty smoothly, save for this one nonsense error message:
</p><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://ilovesymposia.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/picture-6.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-9 aligncenter" src="http://ilovesymposia.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/picture-6.png" alt="" width="460" height="238"></a></p>

Cancelling and retrying made the problem go away (why do computers always defy the most fundamental principle of physics?). You would think that -1.48GB would still evaluate to less than 12.06GB, and so that the backup should have been carried out anyway.</body></html>
